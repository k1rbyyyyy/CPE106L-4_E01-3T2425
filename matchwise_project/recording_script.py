"Welcome to the MatchWise application demonstration. MatchWise is a skill-sharing 
platform that connects people who want to learn skills with those who can teach them.

Today, we'll demonstrate the complete input-output process, showing how users 
register, create listings, and find matches through our intelligent matching algorithm.

Let's start by examining the application architecture..."

SCREEN ACTIONS:
1. Show project folder structure
2. Highlight main components:
   - main.py (FastAPI backend)
   - login_ui.py (Login interface)
   - register_ui.py (Registration interface)  
   - flet_dashboard.py (Main dashboard)
   - matchwise.db (SQLite database)

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Python-based application using Flet UI framework
- FastAPI REST API backend
- SQLite database for data persistence
- Google Maps API for location services
- Real-time matching algorithm with percentage scoring
